## chatgpt-cli: A Simple ChatGPT CLI That Stays Out of Your Way

I recently built **chatgpt-cli**, a minimal command-line interface for interacting with ChatGPT.

👉 **Project link:** [github.com/umbertocicciaa/chatgpt-cli](https://github.com/umbertocicciaa/chatgpt-cli)

The motivation is straightforward: **most existing ChatGPT CLI tools are far more complex than they need to be**.

---

## The Problem with Most ChatGPT CLIs

Search for a ChatGPT CLI today, and you'll typically find tools that:

- Require multiple files, folders, and configuration steps
- Depend on several external libraries
- Try to do *everything* instead of doing one thing well
- Demand more setup time than actual usage time

They're powerful, sure — but often overkill. When all you want is to quickly ask ChatGPT something from the terminal, that complexity becomes friction.

I wanted something closer to the **Unix philosophy**: small, simple, transparent, and easy to modify.

---

## What chatgpt-cli Is

**chatgpt-cli** is:

- A **single file** — that's it
- **Zero external dependencies** — just standard library
- Easy to read, understand, and tweak in minutes
- Focused on one job: chatting with ChatGPT from the terminal

You can open the file, understand exactly how it works, and customize it without digging through a framework or chasing a dependency tree.

**No magic. No bloat. Just a straightforward tool that does what it says.**

---

## Why Simplicity Matters

Simplicity isn't just about fewer lines of code — it's about:

- **Lower cognitive load**: You don't need to learn a framework to use or modify it
- **Faster setup**: Clone, configure your API key, run — that's it
- **Easier debugging**: When something breaks, you know exactly where to look
- **Longer project lifespan**: Simple tools survive because they're easier to maintain

In a world where tooling keeps getting heavier, there's real value in **boring, obvious solutions that just work**.

Simple tools tend to outlive complex ones. They're easier to fork, adapt, and understand — even years later.

---

## Who This Is For

**chatgpt-cli** isn't trying to replace feature-rich clients. It's built for developers who:

- Live in the terminal and prefer staying there
- Want fast feedback loops without context switching
- Prefer tools they can **fully understand** in one sitting
- Value control and transparency over convenience features

For these users, a lightweight CLI becomes part of daily workflows — scripting, brainstorming, debugging, writing documentation — all without leaving the terminal or fighting a complex setup.

---

## How This Could Change Your Workflow

Imagine being able to:

- **Ask quick questions** without opening a browser or switching apps
- **Pipe outputs** directly into other command-line tools
- **Script interactions** with ChatGPT as part of your automation
- **Modify the behavior** by editing a single, readable file

When your tools stay out of the way, you focus on the work — not the tooling.

---

## Final Thoughts

This project exists because I needed it. If you've felt the same frustration with over-engineered tools, you might find **chatgpt-cli** refreshing.

Sometimes, the best innovation isn't adding more features — it's **removing everything that doesn't need to be there**.

If that resonates with you, check it out, fork it, and make it yours.
