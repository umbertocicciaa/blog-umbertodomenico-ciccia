## Introduction

In this post, I‚Äôll share how I passed the **Terraform Associate certification (HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate 003)** with a combination of free and paid resources, hands-on labs, and some tips I wish I knew earlier. If you're preparing for this cert, I hope my experience helps streamline your path.

## Why Terraform?

As someone passionate about DevOps and cloud infrastructure, learning Terraform felt like a natural next step. It‚Äôs declarative, cloud-agnostic, and widely adopted in production environments. Earning the certification helped validate my skills and gave me more confidence when building infrastructure as code (IaC) for personal and professional projects.

## What I Used to Study

### üé• YouTube: Study Guide Video  

I started with this free and very helpful [Terraform Associate study guide by Andrew Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcwo0Gq9T8&t=50s&pp=ygUTdGVycmFmb3JtIGFzc29jaWF0ZQ%3D%3D).  
It breaks down every exam objective clearly and is perfect for building a mental model before diving deeper.

### üß™ Udemy: Practice Tests  

I then reinforced my knowledge with [this Udemy practice test course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam/learn/quiz/5413604#overview).  
These questions were incredibly close to the real exam format and helped me identify weak areas quickly.

### üß∞ Hands-On Lab: My GitHub Automation Lab  

Theory alone isn‚Äôt enough, so I practiced by setting up real infrastructure using my [automation-lab GitHub repo](https://github.com/umbertocicciaa/automation-lab).  
This included writing HCL from scratch, managing state, using backends, and deploying to various environments ‚Äî the best way to learn is by doing.

## How I Structured My Study Plan

- **Week 1:** Watched the full YouTube course and skimmed the official exam guide.
- **Week 2:** Took detailed notes and practiced with hands-on labs in my GitHub repo.
- **Week 3:** Did 2‚Äì3 full-length practice exams from Udemy, reviewed mistakes, and revised.
- **Day Before Exam:** Relaxed, reviewed notes, and ensured I was confident with `terraform plan`, `apply`, `destroy`, backends, state, workspaces, and modules.

## Final Tips

- Read the [official documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) often ‚Äî it‚Äôs what the exam is based on.
- Learn to debug errors and read `terraform plan` outputs ‚Äî very test-relevant.
- Hands-on practice is key. Build something real, even if it's simple.
- Understand core concepts like **providers**, **resources**, **data sources**, and **state** deeply.

## Conclusion

Passing the Terraform Associate wasn‚Äôt just about getting a badge ‚Äî it gave me a solid foundation in infrastructure as code and pushed me to think more modularly and declaratively. I highly recommend this certification if you're on a DevOps, cloud, or platform engineering journey.

Let me know if you‚Äôre preparing too ‚Äî happy to share more tips or resources!
