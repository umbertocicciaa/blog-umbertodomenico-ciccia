# About Me

I'm Umberto Domenico, and welcome to my blog — a space where I share thoughts, lessons, and projects from my journey through cloud, DevOps, full-stack software engineering, and all things IT.

I write about what I build, what I break, and what I learn along the way — from coding and deploying to securing and scaling.

If it's your first time here, check out my featured posts or read more about who I am.
