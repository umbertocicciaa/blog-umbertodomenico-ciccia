## Introduction

Passing the **Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA)** exam was a great milestone in my cloud journey. In this post, I’ll walk you through the strategy I used to prepare and pass the exam on the first attempt. I focused on hands-on experience, curated courses, and repeated quiz practice to reinforce core concepts.

## Why KCNA?

KCNA is a foundational certification offered by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. It’s designed to validate your understanding of Kubernetes, cloud-native principles, container orchestration, and open-source tools in the CNCF landscape.

## My Study Approach

Here’s the exact roadmap I followed:

### 📘 1. KodeKloud KCNA Course

KodeKloud's KCNA course was my primary resource. It explained cloud-native concepts clearly and offered labs that mimicked real-world Kubernetes environments.

- **Why it helped**: Balanced theory and hands-on labs.
- **Pro tip**: Don’t just watch—complete every lab multiple times.

### 🛠️ 2. Hands-On Practice with Personal Projects

I built mini-projects using Kubernetes and Docker on my local machine and in the cloud (via kind, minikube, and k3s).

- **What I practiced**:
  - Deploying containers with YAML
  - ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Volumes
  - Simple Helm charts
  - GitOps with ArgoCD basics

💡 **Tip**: Use open-source CNCF tools to get practical exposure. For example, try integrating Prometheus + Grafana or exploring Fluentd for logging.

### 🧠 3. Udemy Quiz Course

I reinforced my knowledge by solving KCNA-focused quiz questions on Udemy.

- **Why it worked**: Helped me assess weak areas and improve recall.
- **Strategy**: Take the quizzes multiple times and read explanations.

## Exam-Day Tips

- Time management is key—aim to finish the first pass in 45–50 minutes.
- Flag difficult questions and return to them after the first round.
- Trust your preparation and don't second-guess easy answers.

## Final Thoughts

The KCNA is beginner-friendly but still requires dedication and practice. Combining structured learning with hands-on labs and quiz repetition made all the difference for me.

🎯 **If you're aiming to become cloud-native certified, my advice is simple: learn actively, build things, and test yourself often.**
