- **Pre warming**: make fake traffic for keep instance alive periodically

### App Engine

- Servless application deploying
- 1 app engine 1 project
- Regional (cant be changed)

#### Standard vs Flexible

- Standard: low cost/free can scale to zero, extreme spike traffic
- Flexible: docker container environment

#### Scaling

- **Basic scaling:** add new instances for every request. Shutdown instances when application is idle
- **Automatic scaling:** add new instances in base of applications metrics: Can setup a minimum numebr of instances running all the time
- **Manual scaling:** setup the number of instancs

#### **App Engine Versions**

- Page with all version deployed
- You can return to a previos version route all traffic to the previous

#### App settings

in yaml file
