# 🧭 About

**Last updated:** 11:32 PM, 24th April 2025

Welcome to **Umberto Domenico Ciccia's Blog**, a sliding window into my obsessions — ranging from sustainable open source to tech policy advocacy and personal reflections.

I’m a Cloud Engineer and Cybersecurity student with a deep passion for **open source**, **open education**, **cloud** and **DevOps**. Most of the code I write is open source, and I actively maintain projects, including those under the **Unical<3Telegram**.

This blog is where I:

- 📦 Share tutorials and insights from open source projects  
- ✍️ Document unfiltered thoughts and daily ramblings  
- 📰 Publish about my passions
- 🧭 Reflect on tech

AI tools help me think and code faster — but everything you read here is written by me. Writing is how I process the world, and I believe outsourcing thinking doesn’t make sense.
